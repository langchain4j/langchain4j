This folder is here because in [`ClassPathDocumentLoaderTest`](../java/dev/langchain4j/data/document/loader/ClassPathDocumentLoaderTest.java) we need a way to look for things on the classpath, both on the filesystem and packaged inside an archive.

This folder is basically a local Maven repo, where [`langchain4j-classpath-test-lib-999-SNAPSHOT.jar`](dev/langchain4j/langchain4j-classpath-test-lib/999-SNAPSHOT/langchain4j-classpath-test-lib-999-SNAPSHOT.jar) was manually created and published here.

If you look inside [`pom.xml`](../../../pom.xml) you'll notice a `<repositories>` section which adds this folder as a local maven repo. The [maven-install-plugin](https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-install-plugin/examples/specific-local-repo.html) was used to do this.
