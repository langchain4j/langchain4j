At the center of  a black hole density and gravity become infinite, in what is called \\nthe singularity. The boundary region within nothing can escape is called the event horizon. The radius of  this \\nevent horizon, which determines the size of  a black hole, is called Schwarzschild radius and is directly pro-\\nportional to the black hole mass (MBH): RSch=2GMBH/c2 where G is the gravitational constant and c the \\nspeed of  light (see Fig. 1). Mass, spin and charge are the three properties that characterize black holes. A non-\\nrotating black hole with no charge is called Schwarzschild black hole while a rotating one is called Kerr black \\nhole (see History section). At a distance of  1.5 times the Schwarzschild radius of  a non-rotating black hole \\nthere is a spherical boundary where photons moving on tangential trajectories to that sphere are trapped \\naround the black hole in circular orbits. For a Kerr black hole this photon sphere has a radius that depends \\non the spin of  the black hole and the orbit of  the photon. \\nKeywords\\nblack hole mass - accretion - active galactic nuclei - galaxies \\nFig. 1. Anatomy of  a Schwarzschild black hole. The event horizon is spherical and its radius is called Schwarzschild ra-\\ndius (RSch). At 1.5RSch there is the photon sphere inside which photons move around the black hole in circular orbits.  \\nHistory\\nBlack holes were proposed by Karl Schwarzschild in 1916 to solve the Einstein equations of  general relativity. \\nSchwarzschild’s metric described a non-rotation black hole with no charge (Schwarzschild black hole). The \\nsolution for a rotating black hole was found in 1963 by Roy Kerr (Kerr black hole), and that of  a rotating \\nblack hole electrically charged by Ezra Newman in 1965. Several observational techniques have since then \\nprovided evidence for the existence of  black holes (e.g. the detection of  signatures of  black hole accretion, \\nmeasurements of  stellar and gas kinematics within the radius of  influence of  a black hole; see Basic Method-\\nology section). However, it wasn’t until 2016 that the detection of  gravitational waves provided direct evi-\\ndence that black holes exist and merge (Abbott et al. 2016). \\nOverview\\nAccording to their mass, black holes are classified into three types: \\n•  Stellar-mass black holes. They have a mass in the range 3 M⊙ < MBH ≤ 100 M⊙ and form when a mas-\\nsive star (> 15 M•) burns out its fuel supply and its internal pressure is no longer able to support gravita-\\ntional collapse. Most stellar-mass black holes have been detected thanks to being part of  an X-ray binary \\nsystem in which the black hole accretes matter from a stellar companion via an accretion disk. The detec-\\ntion of  X-ray and optical emission from X-ray binaries in the 1970s and 1980s (e.g. Cygnus X-1, LMC-X3; \\nsee review by e.g. Remillard & McClintock 2006) provided the first observational evidence for the existence \\nof  stellar-mass black holes with a mass above 3 M⊙ (i.e. too large for a white dwarf  or a neutron star). Since \\nthen, more than 20 stellar-mass black holes have been confirmed in X-ray binaries (e.g. Casares & Jonker \\n2014). The advent of  gravitational wave interferometers such as LIGO and Virgo has provided the detec-\\ntion of  tens of  additional stellar-mass black holes (see Fig. 2). \\n• Supermassive black holes (SMBHs). They have a mass MBH ≥ 106 M⊙ and reside typically at the center \\nof  massive galaxies (stellar mass M* ≥ 1010 M•). SMBHs of  up to ~109 M⊙  in the local Universe are \\nthought to result from the growth through cosmic time of  stellar-mass black holes of  a few tens of  solar \\nmasses via accretion and mergers with other black holes. The detection of  SMBHs of  up to ~1010 M⊙ \\nwhen the Universe was less than 1 Gyr old (redshift z~7; e.g. Wang et al. 2021) suggests they have to grow \\ninstead from higher-mass seed black holes of  100 M⊙ < MBH < 106 M⊙  at z > 10 in order to reach 1010 M⊙ \\nin such a short time (see Fig. 3). The best observational evidence for the existence of  SMBHs comes from \\nthe measurement of  stellar motions around the Galactic center, which revealed the presence of  a SMBH of  \\n4 x 106 M⊙  (Ghez et al. 2008; Gillessen et al. 2009). More recently, the Event Horizon Telescope collabora-\\ntion provided the first event-horizon-scale image of  (the shadow of) a SMBH in the massive elliptical gal-\\naxy M87 (The EHT Collaboration et al. 2019). A SMBH that is actively accreting matter from its surround-\\ning is called an Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN). An AGN can radiate over a trillion times the energy of  the \\nSun, outshining the galaxy in which it resides. \\n• Intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs). They have a mass 100 M•⊙ < MBH < 106 M⊙ and are thought \\nto be the seeds from which SMBHs in the early Universe grew (see reviews by Mezcua 2017; Greene et al. \\n2020). Such seed IMBHs could form at z > 10 from the death of  Population III stars of  more than 260 \\nM⊙, from direct collapse of  pristine gas, or from runaway mergers in dense stellar clusters, among other \\npossibilities (Rees 1978). They could then rapidly grow via accretion and mergers to become the SMBHs \\nobserved by z~7 (see Fig. 3; Mezcua 2017 and references therein). Those seed black holes that did not \\ngrow should be found in the local Universe as leftover IMBHs, with a mass of  ~102-103 M⊙  if  they origi-\\nnated from Population III stars, of  up to 104 M⊙  if  they originated in nuclear stellar clusters, or of  \\n~104-106 M⊙  if  they formed via direct collapse of  pre-galactic gas. Hundreds of  IMBH candidates have-\\nbeen found in the local Universe (e.g. Reines et al. 2013; Chilingarian et al. 2018; Mezcua & Dominguez \\nSanchez 2020) and out to z~3.4 (Mezcua et al. 2016, 2018b, 2019) as low-mass (MBH < 106 M⊙) AGN in \\ndwarf  galaxies. Because of  their low mass (stellar mass M* ≤ 3 x 109 M⊙) and quiet merger history dwarf  \\ngalaxies are thought to resemble the first galaxies of  the early Universe. Tens of  additional candidates have \\nbeen also found in globular clusters (e.g. Luetzgendorf  et al. 2013; see Table 1 in Mezcua 2017 and refer-\\nences therein) and in the outskirts of  massive galaxies that have recently undergone a merger with a dwarf  \\ngalaxy (e.g. Mezcua et al. 2015, 2018c; Barrows et al. 2019). The best observational evidence for the exis-\\ntence of  IMBHs was provided by the LIGO/Virgo detection of  a local IMBH of  142 M⊙ (Fig. 2; Abbot et \\nal. 2020). \\nA possible forth type of  black holes are primordial black holes. These could have formed in the presence of  \\nhigh-density fluctuations in the inflationary Universe or of  abrupt changes in the plasma pressure, and could \\nhave masses ranging from sub-solar values to 108 M⊙  (e.g. Rubin et al. 2001; Carr et al. 2020; Volonteri et al. \\n2021). Primordial black holes are currently being considered as a form of  dark matter and for interpretation \\nof  gravitational wave events and, if  sufficiently large, they can also be regarded as pregalactic seeds of  \\nSMBHs (e.g. Rubin et al. 2001; García-Bellido 2019; Carr et al. 2020). \\nFig. 3. Formation scenarios for IMBHs. Seed black holes in the early Universe could form from Population III stars, \\nfrom mergers in dense stellar clusters formed out either from the second generation of  stars or from inflows in proto-\\ngalaxies, or from direct collapse of  dense gas in protogalaxies, and grow via accretion and merging to 109 M⊙ by red-\\nshift z~7. SMBHs could also directly form by mergers of  protogalaxies at z~6. Those seed black holes that did not \\ngrow into SMBHs can be found in the local Universe as leftover IMBHs.

Other (indirect) methods, used to estimate the mass of  a few IMBH candidates, include the \\ndetection of  quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) and applying an inverse scaling relation found for stellar-mass \\nblack holes between QPO frequency and black hole mass (e.g. Pasham et al. 2014). \\nIn globular clusters, the black hole mass of  several IMBH candidates has been derived based on stellar kine-\\nmatics and surface brightness profiles combined with dynamical modeling (e.g. Gebhardt et al. 2005; Luetz-\\ngendorf  et al. 2013). However, the absence of  any signatures of  accretion in the form of  X-ray or radio \\nemission precludes confirming the presence of  IMBHs in these sources (e.g. Wrobel et al. 2020). \\nIn the case of  SMBHs, the best black hole mass measurements come from the monitoring of  stellar proper \\nmotions around the black hole (e.g. Ghez et al. 2008; Gillessen et al. 2009) and from dynamical modeling of  \\nstellar and gas kinematics within the black hole sphere of  influence (see review by e.g. Kormendy & Ho \\n2013). Such dynamical mass measurements have been also possible for a few nearby IMBHs (e.g. Davis et al. \\n2020). Beyond the local Universe (the Local Group in the case of  IMBHs), where spatial resolution prevents \\nperforming such dynamical mass measurements, the detection of  IMBHs and SMBHs has to rely on the find-\\ning of  signatures of  accretion in the form of  AGN.  \\nActive galactic nuclei (AGN). \\nAGN can be identified across the electromagnetic spectrum. In the optical and infrared regime, the presence \\nof  AGN ionization can be distinguished from ionization by galactic star formation using emission line diag-\\nnostic diagrams. AGN can be also identified by the detection of  broad emission lines coming from gas clouds \\nmoving at velocities of  ~3000 km/s around the central SMBH (the so-called ‘broad line region’). In the case \\nof  low-mass AGN in dwarf  galaxies, these velocities can be of  just hundreds of  km/s (e.g. Reines et al. \\n2013). Such low velocities can be mimicked by some varieties of  supernovae; however, unlike AGN, the \\nbroad line emission in supernovae would significantly decrease or disappear over a timespan of  5-15 years \\n(e.g. Baldassare et al. 2016). In AGN with broad emission lines, the flux and width of  the line can be used to \\nestimate the black hole mass under the assumption that the gas in the broad line region is virialised. \\nIn the mid-infrared regime, color-color diagrams can be also used to identify AGN (e.g. Stern et al. 2012). \\nThese diagrams are based on the colors that dust presents when heated by different mechanisms such as \\nAGN or stars.  \\nThe detection of  hard (2-10 keV band) X-ray emission from the corona of  electrons sitting above the accre-\\ntion disk around a black hole is a very strong tracer of  black hole accretion. In massive galaxies, AGN can be \\nidentified as having an X-ray luminosity typically above 1042 erg/s. In dwarf  galaxies, the AGN X-ray lumi-\\nnosity can be as low as 1038-39 erg/s, probing very low rates of  accretion (e.g. Gallo et al. 2010). In this case, \\nthe contribution from X-ray binaries to the X-ray emission must be removed in order to confirm the pres-\\nence of  AGN (e.g. Mezcua et al. 2016, 2018b). \\nSome AGN eject a pair of  collimated jets of  relativistic plasma that radiate across the electromagnetic spec-\\ntrum via synchrotron emission. These jets are best observed at radio wavelengths, and their detection is a \\ncommon tracer of  AGN activity. Radio luminosities at 1.4 GHz above 1024 W/Hz are typically used to identi-\\nfy AGN, as these high radio luminosities cannot be explained even by extreme star formation. In the case of  \\ndwarf  star-forming galaxies, the radio contribution from star formation processes must be removed in order \\nto infer the presence of  AGN (e.g. Mezcua et al. 2019). \\nGravitational waves. \\nGravitational waves are ripples in the space-time that propagate at the speed of  light. They are generated by \\nmassive accelerated objects such as two merging black holes. In a black hole binary, gravitational waves are \\nemitted during the inspiral phase, the merger, and the final ring-down. This was the case of  the first detection \\nof  gravitational waves by the LIGO and Virgo interferometers in 2015, when two black holes of  29 and 36 \\nM⊙ merged into a new black hole of  62 M⊙ (Abbott et al. 2016). Since then, tens of  gravitational wave ob-\\nservations resulting from the merger of  two stellar-mass black holes have been reported (Fig. 1). One of  such \\nblack hole binaries resulted in a final black hole of  142 M⊙, thus in the IMBH regime (Abbott et al. 2020). \\nThe detection of  gravitational waves from SMBH binaries will have to await the next generation of  space-\\nbased interferometers (e.g. Amaro-Seoane et al. 2018). \\nFig. 5.

This implies that the same \\ndisc-jet connection governing stellar-mass black holes does also take place in SMBHs (e.g. Falcke et al. 2004). \\nObservational evidence for this universality of  black hole accretion comes from the finding of  a correlation \\nbetween X-ray luminosity (proxy of  accretion flow), radio luminosity (proxy of  jet emission), and black hole \\nmass extending from stellar-mass to SMBHs (the so-called Fundamental Plane of  Black Hole Accretion; see \\nFig. 4; e.g. Merloni et al. 2003; Plotkin et al. 2012). The Fundamental Plane of  Black Hole Accretion can be \\nused to estimate black hole masses when nuclear radio and X-ray luminosities are available (e.g. Mezcua et al. \\n2015, 2018c: Gultekin et al. 2019). \\nBlack hole-galaxy co-evolution. \\nAnother key finding in black hole studies is that of  a correlation between the mass of  SMBHs and some host \\ngalaxy properties, such as bulge luminosity, stellar mass, or stellar velocity dispersion (see review by e.g. Kor-\\nmendy & Ho 2013), which implies that SMBHs and their host galaxies co-evolve (see Fig. 5). While this syn-\\nchronized black hole-galaxy growth was originally found for SMBHs of  > 106 M⊙, recent studies have ex-\\ntended these correlations to the IMBH regime, where a flattening or large scatter seems to be observed (e.g. \\nMartin-Navarro & Mezcua 2018; Baldassare et al. 2020; Greene et al. 2020). Feedback from the AGN onto \\nthe host galaxy is thought to be the main mechanism behind such black hole-galaxy evolution, via winds or \\njets that impact the formation of  stars in the host galaxy and thus regulate its growth. Observational evidence \\nfor AGN feedback in massive galaxies comes from the finding that the radio jets of  SMBHs fill the large-\\nscale X-ray cavities of  some galaxy clusters (e.g. McNamara et al. 2000). The effects of  AGN feedback in \\ndwarf  galaxies is not so clear, but recent simulations (e.g. Sharma et al. 2020 and references therein) and ob-\\nservations (e.g. Mezcua et al. 2019; Liu et al. 2020) indicate it could be as significant as in massive galaxies. \\nFuture Directions\\nThe next generation of  observational facilities will provide a major step forward in our understanding of  \\nblack hole formation and evolution and the physics behind black hole accretion. Future radio observatories \\nsuch as the Square Kilometer Array (SKA) and X-ray satellites such as Athena or the mission-concept Lynx \\nwill provide a complete coverage of  the phases that stellar-mass black hole transients undergo (i.e. the disk-jet \\ncoupling mechanism) and be able to detect SMBHs and their seed IMBHs out to z=10 (e.g. Yu et al. 2015; \\nMezcua et al. 2018a; Whalen et al. 2020). In the new era of  gravitational-wave astronomy, the Einstein Tele-\\nscope will capture the gravitational-wave signal from millions of  coalescing stellar binary black holes de-\\ntectable out to z~15 and up to masses of  103 M⊙  characteristic of  (growing) black hole seeds, while LISA will \\ndetect the gravitational-wave signal from massive binary black hole coalescences (~ 104 M⊙  to ~107 M⊙  ) \\nacross all cosmic ages (e.g. Amaro-Seoane et al. 2018). A future of  exciting discoveries awaits us.  \\nSee Also\\n→ Active Galactic Nuclei \\n→ Black Holes \\n→ Galaxy \\n→ Globular Cluster \\n→ Radio Astronomy \\n→ X-ray binaries \\nReferences\\nAbbott B.

INTRODUCTION\\nThe nature of dark matter remains one of the most pressing mysteries in modern cos-\\nmology and particle physics. While numerous candidates have been proposed, from weakly\\ninteracting massive particles to axions, the search for the fundamental nature of the dark\\nmatter and of the “dark sector” it resides in continues. In recent years, attention has also\\nkeenly turned to the possibility of dark sectors governed by gauge theories analogous to\\nQuantum Chromodynamics (QCD) in the Standard Model.\\nThe present study explores a novel mechanism for dark matter production in the early\\nuniverse through the formation of black holes from dark baryons in confining SU(N) gauge\\ntheories. We demonstrate that under specific conditions, these dark baryon black holes\\n(DBBHs) can form and, under suitable assumptions, potentially constitute the entirety of\\nthe observed dark matter.\\nOur approach builds upon the rich framework of dark SU(N) theories, which have been\\nstudied extensively for their potential to explain various astrophysical phenomena and to\\nprovide new dark matter candidates. By considering the large N limit and the interplay\\nbetween the confinement scale, quark masses, and dark sector temperature, we derive the\\nphysical conditions under which dark baryons can collapse into black holes, and compute\\nthe resulting black holes’ mass and abundance.\\nThe formation of primordial black holes (PBHs) as dark matter has been a subject of\\nsignificant interest. However, our mechanism differs from traditional PBH formation sce-\\nnarios in that it relies on the intrinsic properties of dark sector particles rather than density\\nfluctuations in the early universe.\\nIn this work, we first review the properties of hadrons in SU(N) gauge theories, focusing\\non their scaling behavior in the large N limit. We then derive the conditions for dark\\nbaryon collapse into black holes and explore the cosmological implications of these objects.\\nFinally, we present numerical results that demonstrate the viability of DBBHs as dark matter\\ncandidates and discuss the parameter space where this scenario can be realized.\\n3\\nII. DARK CONFINING SU(N) THEORIES\\nThe question of the nature of dark matter and, more broadly, of physics beyond the\\nStandard Model, has led to the investigation of dark, confining SU(N) and non-Abelian\\ngauge theories. These theories offer a rich framework for addressing fundamental questions\\nin particle physics and cosmology, providing novel approaches to dark matter candidates\\nand mechanisms for explaining various astrophysical phenomena. This class of theories are\\nparticularly attractive due to their similarity to QCD in the Standard Model, and build on\\nthe rich topical area of QCD’s large N limit studies. For instance, Ref. [1] investigated an\\nSU(3) dark gauge theory coupled only to gravity. In their model, stable scalar glueballs\\nemerge as potential dark matter candidates. Further extending this line of research, Ref. [2]\\nexamined an SU(4) gauge theory for composite dark matter. This construction builds upon\\nprevious studies of SU(N) theories, exploring the rich phenomenology that emerges from\\nlarger gauge groups. Ref. [3] explored both stable mesons and baryons, or a combination\\nthereof, in single-flavor dark SU(N) (see also [4–7] for recent studies); a comprehensive review\\nof similar models and theoretical constructions is presented in Ref. [8].\\nBeyond their applications to dark matter, non-Abelian gauge theories have been explored\\nfor their potential to explain other cosmological phenomena. For instance, Ref. [9] proposed\\na dark sector model based on a non-Abelian gauge theory that links vacuum-dominated in-\\nflation with dark matter production. This approach offers a mechanism for smooth reheating\\nand provides potential explanations for dark matter generation within a unified framework.\\nThe study of strongly coupled gauge theories has also yielded insights into physics beyond\\nthe Standard Model. These theories offer rich phenomenology that can be similar to or dis-\\ntinct from QCD, providing potential explanations for composite dark matter and shedding\\nlight on the nature of electroweak symmetry breaking [10]. Various other phenomenological\\npredictions and implications include dark radiation [11], sources for stochastic gravitational\\nwaves [12], multi-component dark matter [13], and dark sector self-interactions [14].\\nIn the present study we are especially concerned with determining whether high-\\nmultiplicity hadronic configurations can compress into regions sufficiently compact to reach\\nthe Schwarzschild radius, triggering gravitational collapse. Theoretical studies suggest that\\nflux tubes connecting quarks during confinement can store sufficient energy density to drive\\nthe formation of PBHs, a mechanism previously studied for general confining gauge the-\\n4\\nories [15]. While many of these studies originate from visible-sector QCD analogies [16],\\nrecent extensions to dark SU(N) scenarios have explored related concepts [17].\\nIn contrast to studies focused on black hole formation, much of the recent work on dark\\nSU(N) gauge theories has centered on the dynamics of dense multi-quark hadrons formed\\nduring early-universe phase transitions [18, 19]. These studies describe scenarios in which\\nheavy quarks are trapped in deconfined-phase pockets during first-order phase transitions,\\nresulting in the formation of N -quark bound states either in bulk regions or at bubble wall\\nboundaries. These dense hadronic configurations have been investigated primarily as poten-\\ntial dark matter candidates [3, 20, 21], with analyses focusing on relic abundances, annihila-\\ntion processes, and stability properties. However, direct connections between such compact,\\nhigh-mass multi-quark bound states and gravitational collapse remain unexplored, to our\\nknowledge. While progress has been made in understanding compactness thresholds [15, 16],\\nand dense configurations in phase transitions [18–20], a comprehensive framework addressing\\nthe explicit gravitational triggers for black hole formation in dark-sector N -quark systems\\nis still lacking. Our work seeks to build on these foundations by analyzing the critical mass,\\ninteraction effects, and confinement dynamics necessary for such phenomena.\\nIII. HADRON PROPERTIES IN THE LARGE N LIMIT\\nIn QCD, the SU(3) gauge theory describing the strong nuclear force, hadrons are com-\\nposite particles formed by quarks bound by gluons [22]. The size of these hadrons is a result\\nof the balance between the confining force, characterized by the QCD scale ΛQCD, and the\\nproperties of the constituent quarks, particularly their masses [23]. Extending this concept\\nto a general SU(N) theory allows one to explore how hadron properties scale with the num-\\nber of colors N , providing valuable insights into the large-N limit of gauge theories [24]. In\\nthis broader context, we consider here a confinement scale Λ analogous to ΛQCD in standard\\nQCD, and a set of Nf quark flavors all with the same mass mQ, for simplicity.\\nThe study of the large N limit of SU(N) gauge theories, first proposed by ’t Hooft [25], has\\nproven to be a powerful tool for understanding non-perturbative aspects of QCD and related\\nstrong interaction theories. This approach provides insight into the behavior of hadrons,\\nincluding glueballs, mesons, and baryons, as the number of colors N approaches infinity [26,\\n27]. In this limit, the properties of such particles exhibit distinct scaling behaviors with\\n5\\nrespect to N , the confinement scale Λ, and the quark mass mQ. Glueballs and mesons\\nmaintain finite masses as N increases, while baryons become parametrically heavier [28] – a\\nkey feature in what follows. This scaling leads to a clear hierarchy in the hadron spectrum\\nand, incidentally, offers explanations for various phenomena observed in QCD.\\nA. Hadron Masses\\nAs N approaches infinity, baryons, composed of N quarks, exhibit a mass scaling that\\nis linear with respect to N This scaling relation emerges from several theoretical consider-\\nations. Witten [26] first proposed this behavior arguing that in the large N limit, baryons\\ncan be treated as a bound state of N quarks in a mean-field approximation. The linear N -\\ndependence arises from both the quark content and the binding energy of the system. The\\n’t Hooft limit [25], where λ = g2N is held fixed as N → ∞ (with g the gauge coupling), pro-\\nvides a framework for understanding this scaling. In this limit, planar diagrams dominate,\\nsimplifying the many-body problem of N quarks and leading to the observed linear scaling\\nof baryon masses. Lattice QCD simulations have provided numerical evidence supporting\\nthese large N predictions, particularly in the pure gauge sector [29]. While direct experi-\\nmental verification is challenging due to the fixed value of N=3 in our physical world, these\\ntheoretical insights have profound implications for our understanding of strong interactions\\nand the structure of hadrons.\\nIn the light quark limit, the masses of glueballs and mesons scale as M ∼ O(1)×Λ, iwith\\nΛ the confinement scale, independent of N . For mesons with heavy quarks (mQ ≫ Λ), there\\nis an additional contribution proportional to the quark mass, and the meson mass, in the\\nheavy quark limit, goes as 2mQ; for intermediate mQ ∼ Λ, the mass ∼\\n√\\nmQΛ. Baryon\\nmasses, in contrast, grow linearly with N, scaling as Mbaryon ∼ NΛ for light quarks and\\nMbaryon ∼ NmQ +O(NΛ2/mQ) for heavy quarks [30].1\\n1 Note that with a single flavor, the lowest-lying bound state is the analogue of the Standard Model η′, the\\nsingle pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone Boson meson associated with the breaking of the accidental axial U(1)\\nsymmetry, with mass ∼ Λ/\\n√\\nN [13, 31, 32].\\n6\\nB. Hadron size\\nThe size of the smallest hadron in largeN SU(N) is primarily determined by the two scales\\nin the problem: the confinement scale Λ and the quark mass mq. In the heavy quark regime,\\nthe hadron size scales approximately as RH ∼ 1/mq, reflecting the localization of the quark\\nwave function due to its large mass [33]. This behavior is well-understood in the context of\\nheavy quark effective theory [34]. Conversely, for light quarks (mq ≪ Λ), the hadron size\\nis governed by the confinement scale: RH ∼ 1/Λ [35]. This regime is particularly relevant\\nfor understanding the properties of pions and other light mesons in QCD, where chiral\\nsymmetry breaking plays a crucial role [36]. Note that in the intermediate regime where\\nmq ∼ Λ, both scales contribute significantly to the hadron size. A reasonable approximation\\nin this case is RH ∼ 1/\\n√\\nm2\\nq + Λ2, which smoothly interpolates between the heavy and light\\nquark limits [37].\\nThe dependence of hadron size on the number of colors N is generally weaker than its\\ndependence on Λ and mq. As N increases, the binding energy of the hadron typically\\nincreases, which could lead to a slight decrease in size [32]. However, this effect is usually\\nsubdominant to the mass and confinement scale dependencies. For mesons and glueballs,\\nwe estimate that the typical size of the smallest hadron of N quarks in a confining SU(N)\\ntheory with coupling αD ∼ 1 can be approximated as:\\nRhadron ∼ 1\\nαD max(Λ,mq)\\n(1)\\nThe scaling with N of baryon size is instead less trivial. Theoretical analyses and lat-\\ntice QCD studies consistently demonstrate that while baryon masses scale linearly with\\nN , their spatial extent remains approximately constant. In the large-N limit, baryons can\\nbe described as solitons or quantum Hall droplets [38]. The soliton picture, applicable for\\nNf ≥ 2, arises from the topological properties of the chiral Lagrangian, with baryon number\\nidentified as a conserved topological charge. For Nf = 1, where Skyrmions are inapplicable,\\nbaryons can be interpreted as quantum Hall droplets with a size L ∼\\n√\\nN/Tsheet ∼ O(1) in\\nQCD units, where Tsheet ∼ N is the sheet tension [38].\\nLattice QCD studies provide numerical evidence for these scaling laws. Simulations\\nwith N = 3, 5, 7 demonstrate that baryon masses follow MN ∝ N , while their spatial\\nextents remain consistent with N -independence [39].

DARK BARYON BLACK HOLES FORMATION\\nThe condition for hadron collapse into black holes is that the size of the hadron RH be\\nsmaller than the Schwarzschild radius corresponding to the hadron mass MH ,\\nRH < RS(MH) ∼\\nMH\\nM2\\nP\\n, (3)\\nwith MP the Planck mass. For glueballs, this condition directly implies Λ > MP , which\\nis nonphysical, as the confinement phase transition should occur after inflation and at sub-\\n8\\nPlanckian temperatures. For mesons, the same is true in the light-quark case, while in the\\nheavy quark case one has\\n1\\nmQ\\n<\\n2mQ\\nM2\\nP\\n, (4)\\nimplying a Planck-scale value for mQ, which is arguably unnatural.\\nFor baryons, instead, the condition reads\\n1\\nmax(Λ,mQ)\\n<\\nNmax(Λ,mQ)\\nM2\\nP\\n, (5)\\nthus, indicating with X ≡ max(Λ,mQ)/MP ,\\nX > N−1/2, (6)\\nallowing for significantly sub-Planckian Λ or mQ in the large N limit. Note that the black\\nhole resulting from dark baryon collapse has a mass NX in Planck units. Requiring that\\nthe object is indeed a black hole implies, in turn, that MBH > MP , i.e. NX > 1.\\nIn summary, the condition for black hole formation are\\nX >\\n1\\nN1/2\\n>\\n1\\nN\\n. (7)\\nThe time scale for dark baryon collapse into a black hole, corresponding to the hole’s\\ndynamical time scale, i.e. its light crossing time, reads\\ntd ∼\\nNmax(Λ,mQ)\\nM2\\nP\\n. (8)\\nDark baryons therefore form black holes on a time scale that corresponds to the largest\\nbetween the collapse and formation time scales (they need to coalesce before collapse), i.e.\\nin a time\\ntformation = max\\n(\\nNmax(Λ,mQ)\\nM2\\nP\\n,\\n1\\nΛ\\n)\\n, (9)\\nwhere we have assumed that the hadronization time-scale tbaryon ∼ 1/Λ is N -independent\\n[32, 38, 39]. If Λ > mQ this implies, since Λ/MP > N−1/2 for DBBH to form, that black\\nholes form after dark baryon formation, i.e. tformation = td > tbaryon. If instead Λ < mQ black\\nholes may form promptly upon dark baryon collapse if\\nmQΛ\\nM2\\nP\\n<\\n1\\nN\\n. (10)\\n9\\nDark baryons cannot form arbitrarily late, as the dark plasma abundance must disappear\\nby Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN), occurring at temperatures TBBN ∼ 1 MeV and at a\\ntime tBBN ∼ MP/T\\n2\\nBBN.

Experimental tests constrain deviations δG/G at different scales, in particular\\nδG/G ≲ 10−2 at submillimeter scales [41]. Calmet et al., Ref. [42], derive the quadratic\\nrunning\\nG−1(µ) ∼ G−1 − Ndofµ\\n2\\n12π\\n, (12)\\nleading to an upper bound, given the constraint quoted above, of Ndof ∼ N2 ≲ 1032 to\\nprevent quantum gravity effects below µ ∼ TeV (see also [43] for a more extensive discussion\\non limits on a large number of dark degrees of freedom). This, in turn, implies thatN ≲ 1016,\\na stronger limit than what quoted above from the collapse time-scale being shorter than the\\ntimescale of light element synthesis.\\nWe note that the running in Eq. (12) affects the conditions above for (i) black hole collapse\\nas well as for the requirements of (ii) the formed black hole to be trans-Planckian and (iii)\\nthe quark masses to be sub-Planckian. Given the speculative nature of a renormalization-\\ngroup treatment of the running of the Planck scale, we postpone the detailed discussion of\\nthese effects to App. A below2.\\nV. DARK BARYON BLACK HOLES FATE\\nUpon confinement, dark glueballs and mesons are much more abundant than baryons,\\nsince, in the large N limit, the dark baryon abundance is suppressed by a Boltzmann factor\\n∼ e−N . While it is possible that the lightest bound state be the dark matter (see e.g. [13]),\\nas pointed out above stable dark glueballs or mesons do not lead to collapse to black holes.\\n2 The Author is grateful to Graham Kribbs for prompting him to explore the question of the running of\\nthe Planck scale\\n10\\nWe will therefore assume that either higher-dimensional operators mediate the decay of the\\nlowest-mass bound state, or that the resulting relic abundance is small compared to the\\ndark matter abundance. This ensures that the dark sector exclusively, or almost exclusively\\nyields dark baryons, which we assume to be stable of very long-lived. We note that in\\nconfining dark sectors, the stability of the lightest baryon is often ensured by accidental\\nsymmetries, analogous to baryon number conservation in the Standard Model. In fact,\\nthe emergence of an accidental U(1) dark baryon number symmetry is a generic feature of\\nconfining theories with fermionic constituents, and the U(1) global symmetry arises naturally\\nin the renormalizable Lagrangian of dark QCD-like theories [44, 45].\\nIn addition to the population produced promptly at confinement, dark baryons B are\\ngenerically “frozen in” by processes such as (M,G) + (M,G) → B̄B, with M and G the\\nlowest-mass meson or glueball, with a cross section ∼ e−2ccN , with cc an O(1) factor describ-\\ning the amplitude of the process and corresponding, in order of magnitude, to the absolute\\nvalue of the logarithm of the probability to produce (annihilate) a single color quark pair\\n[13] (the pair annihilation of dark baryons is negligible below the confinement phase tran-\\nsition, therefore the frozen in population is not depleted by subsequent dark baryon pair\\nannihilation).\\nWe shall hereafter assume that the DBBHs formed upon dark baryon collapse do not\\nundergo the semiclassical process of Hawking evaporation, and are therefore stable. This\\nassumption is motivated by a number of considerations. First, when MDBBH ∼ MP , the\\nSchwarzschild radius becomes comparable to the Planck length, rendering spacetime fluc-\\ntuations non-negligible [46]. The derivation of Hawking radiation assumes field modes with\\narbitrarily high frequencies near the horizon [47]. Close to the Planck scale, these modes\\nprobe sub-Planckian distances where: (1) The semiclassical approximation breaks down, (2)\\nQuantum gravity effects dominate, and (3) The black hole’s entropy S = kBA/4ℓ\\n2\\nP , with ℓP\\nthe Planck length, approaches O(1), suggesting information capacity collapse [48]. Recent\\nanalyses show suppressed emission rates Γ ∼ e−S for M < qmP (q ∼ 0.5) due to memory\\nburden effects [49]. Lattice simulations in analogue gravity models demonstrate evaporation\\nhalting when Rs ≈ 2ℓP , consistent with energy conservation in modified dispersion relations\\n[50]. The loss of thermodynamic description at TH ∼ TP/8π further suggests kinematic clo-\\nsure of evaporation [51]. We consider the stability of DBBHs, therefore, as a rather plausible\\npossibility. Should that possibility be violated, DBBHs would evaporate very quickly, but\\n11\\npossibly produce, upon evaporation, cosmologically interesting relics, including, potentially,\\nthe dark matter [52].\\nThe comoving number density Y = n/s of dark baryons produced at confinement is\\nYΛ ∼ e−2cN , where the exponential suppression, again, stems from the probability of quarks\\nof different colors “finding” one another. Dark baryons are additionally “frozen in” from\\nbaryon-antibaryon production from meson or glueball collisions, as explained above.

Sub-Planckian black holes correspond in the\\nregion to the top-right of the green line. Given that N ≲ 100, the figure implies that DBBH\\nhave, at most, a mass Nmax(Λ,mQ) ∼ 100 MP .\\nA final remark pertains to the scale of the confinement phase transition. The latter must\\noccur at temperatures below the reheating temperature, Λ < ξTreh, least the abundance\\nof the produced DBBH be exponential diluted by the inflationary epoch5. It is important,\\ntherefore, to summarize the state of the art for inflationary models with the highest-possible\\nreheating temperature.\\nAnalytical studies frequently identify Treh ∼ 1015GeV as the upper bound, derived from\\nthe inflaton’s energy density at the end of inflation and slow-roll conditions limiting the scale\\nof inflation [56]. Observational constraints, such as measurements of the scalar spectral index\\n5 Again, it may well be that the DBBH abundance be so large that it would survive inflationary dilution,\\nsee above.\\n16\\nns and non-detection of primordial gravitational waves, further restrict Treh, with stricter\\nlimits in scenarios with fewer e-folds during inflation, where Treh ∼ 1013GeV has been\\nproposed [57]. We also note that thermodynamical processes such as preheating through\\nparametric resonance can create transient maximum temperatures Tmax > Treh, although\\nbackreaction effects and thermalization bottlenecks prevent Treh itself from approaching\\ntrans-Planckian scales [58, 59].\\nReheating temperatures approaching the Planck scale, however, are not in principle firmly\\nruled out. First, modified inflationary scenarios like k-inflation [60] alter the relation between\\nr and the energy scale, introducing a reduced sound speed Cs for perturbations\\nr = −8Csnt (Cs < 1),\\nrelaxing the bound on the inflationary energy scale. Similarly, multifield models [61] modify\\nthe consistency relation through adiabatic mode evolution, weakening the r-energy scale\\nlinkage. Second, a speculative resolution posits that quantum gravity effects might suppress\\ntensor mode production entirely if gravity remains non-quantized [62], decoupling r from the\\ninflationary energy scale. While these approaches circumvent observational limits, achiev-\\ning scalar spectrum normalization at such high energies remains challenging, necessitating\\ncareful model-building to reconcile the required reheating temperature with cosmological\\nconsistency conditions.\\nIn the present context, however, one should not compare the dark sector temperature\\nwith limits on Treh but, rather, the Standard Model temperature, TSM = TDS/ξ. Therefore,\\nsince for Λ > mQ we find, from fig. 3 that Λ ≳ 0.2MP , the condition Λ < ξTreh ≲ ξ 1015\\nGeV implies that ξ ≳ 2 × 103. We indicate this constraint with a horizontal dashed line\\nin fig. 3. The ξ ≲ 2 × 103 is not firmly ruled out because of the considerations above. For\\nmQ > Λ, instead, Λ can be much below mQ ≳ 0.2MP (again from fig. 3) and the dark sector\\nneed not be as hot, meaning that any value of ξ is possible.\\nA few remarks are additionally in order here: first, accretion onto Planck-scale relics of\\nmass M is always irrelevant. To prove this, we compare the mass accretion rate with the\\nHubble rate at temperature T ,\\n1\\nM\\ndM\\ndt\\n∼ 1\\nM\\n(σ · ρ(T )) ∼ 1\\nM\\n(\\nM\\nM2\\nP\\n)2\\nT 4; H ∼ T 2\\nMP\\n, (26)\\n17\\nwhich shows that\\n1\\nH\\n(\\n1\\nM\\ndM\\ndt\\n)\\n∼ MP\\nT 2\\n1\\nM\\n(\\nM\\nM2\\nP\\n)2\\nT 4 ∼\\n(\\nM\\nMP\\n)(\\nT\\nMP\\n)2\\n≪ 1, (27)\\nsince the first factor in the last equation is at most ∼ 100, while the latter is ≲ 10−6 given\\nlimits on the maximal reheating temperature.\\nSecondly, the merger rate for Planck-scale relics is also negligible compared to the Hubble\\nrate. Peters’ formula for binary formation from gravitational radiation [63] indicates that\\nthe merger time scale for black holes of mass M is approximately\\nτmerger ∼ M6\\nP\\na4\\nM3\\n, (28)\\nwith a the orbital separation, given by the n−1/3, with n the number density of black holes,\\nn(T ) ≲\\ns(T )\\ns0\\nρDM\\nM\\n∼ g∗,SM T 3 10−4 GeV\\nM\\n∼ 10−21 T 3 MP\\nM\\n(29)\\nthus\\na ∼ n−1/3 ∼ 107\\n1\\nT\\n(\\nMP\\nM\\n)−1/3\\n.

CONCLUSIONS\\nThis study considered the possibility that SU(N) dark-sector theories produce Planck-\\nscale black holes upon the collapse of dark baryons. We showed that DBBHs can naturally\\narise if either the confinement scale or the quark mass is close to the Planck scale, assuming\\ndark mesons and glueballs decay to visible-sector particles. In the large N limit, the dark\\nbaryon abundance is exponentially suppressed with N , but it receives a significant contri-\\nbution from freeze-in processes where two mesons or glueballs produce out-of-equilibrium\\nbaryon-antibaryon pairs.\\nDBBHs can have the right abundance to be the dark matter – provided Hawking evapo-\\nration is suppressed – for several combinations of N , the dark-to-visible sector temperature\\nratios, and the effective exponential suppression for the production cross section of dark\\n18\\nbaryons. An alternate possibility, arising for sufficiently hot dark sectors and low N , is that\\nthe DBBH abundance is large enough that it could produce the right dark matter abundance\\neven upon inflationary dilution.\\nBecause of the exponential suppression withN , we find that even for very hot dark sectors,\\nN cannot exceed values around 100, implying that the mass of the produced DBBHs cannot\\nexceed a few hundreds times the Planck mass. This implies DBBH masses at most of a few\\nmilligrams.\\nFinally, the requirement that the confinement phase transition occur at temperatures\\nbelow reheating forces hot dark sectors in the light-quark regime, barring exotic inflationary\\nscenarios that allow Planck-scale reheating temperatures, but it is easily satisfied for Planck-\\nscale quark masses in the heavy quark regime.\\nWe showed that the resulting DBBH population is entirely unaffected by either accretion\\nor mergers, and it produces an effect on the matter power spectrum only at extremely small\\nscales.\\nPlanck-scale relics can potentially acquire electric charge, which would make them de-\\ntectable, most prominently with so-called paleo-detectors [64, 65]. Additionally, mergers of\\nDBBHs may lead to both the production of high-frequency gravitational waves, and to the\\nproduction of particles if the resulting final mass is above the threshold for evaporation.\\nIn the Appendix we discuss how our results are effected taking into account the possible\\nrenormalization group evolution of Newton’s gravitational constant. We find that the overall\\npicture is unchanged, but that the requirement of collapse into DBBH presents stricter\\nconstraints, limiting the maximal DBBH mass to roughly 6 units of the bare Planck scale.\\nAs a final remark, we note that if dark baryons are sub-critical, i.e. have a size close,\\nbut smaller, than their Schwarzschild radius, it is possible that bound “dark nuclei” form,\\nmediated by dark glueballs and mesons. Such objects may, in principle, and in turn, collapse\\ninto “dark nuclei black holes”. We leave this possibility for future study, although naive\\nestimates based on the scaling of the dark nuclei size and mass with the dark nucleon\\nnumber A,\\nRN ∼ A1/3\\nΛ\\n, MN ∼ A max (Λ,mQ) (32)\\nsuggest that dark nuclei black hole would form for sufficiently large A\\nA ≫\\n(\\nMP\\nΛ\\n)3\\n(Λ > mQ); A ≫\\n(\\nM2\\nP\\nΛmQ\\n)3/2\\n(Λ < mQ).

Fur-\\nthermore, the possible existence of additional new physics, as noted above, or fundamental\\n21\\ndiscreteness at the Planck scale [71] could invalidate the continuous RG flow picture.\\n[1] A.

In principle, dark matter could come in various\\nshades, for example, it can be of particulate nature (e.g., weakly interacting massive particles,\\naxions etc.) having widely distributed mass range or it can be some compact object of\\nprimordial origin, like primordial black hole (PBH). Primordial back holes were first proposed\\nin [1], and since then it has been the center of interest to the community. After the discovery of\\ngravitational waves by the LIGO and Virgo collaborations (LVC) [2] almost a decade ago, the\\ninterest on PBHs was resurrected with new vigour. For long time many different mechanisms\\nhave been proposed regarding the origin of PBH, e.g. collapse from inhomogeneities during\\nradiation- [3, 4] and matter-dominated era [5–8], critical collapse [9, 10], collapse in single [11–\\n16] and multi-field inflationary models [17–20], collapse of cosmic string loops [21, 22], collapse\\nduring a first order phase transition (FOPT) [23] to name a few. Recently, a number of novel\\nmechanisms have been proposed related to the creation of PBHs during a FOPT. Some\\nof these are model-dependent mechanisms, i.e. the particle content and the interactions\\nof the model decides whether there will be any creation of PBH during a FOPT [24–26],\\nwhereas the others are model-independent [27–30]. These model-independent mechanisms\\npropose the creation of PBH through collapse of overdense regions in the early universe\\nwhere these regions are formed due to the asynchronous nature of nucleation of true vacuum\\nbubbles during a FOPT. Furthermore, many of these PBH forming mechanisms, i.e. scalar\\nperturbation [31–33], inflation [34–37], cosmic strings [38–40], FOPT [41, 42] can also be the\\nsources of stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) in the Universe.\\n– 1 –\\nThis SGWB and the properties of the PBH, i.e. their mass and abundance etc. depend\\non the mechanisms through which they were created. Apart from this, PBHs, if they exist,\\nwill interact gravitationally with themselves and other astrophysical black holes (ABH). In\\nprinciple, these gravitational interactions can also create SGWB in the detectable range\\nof the proposed GW detectors depending on the mass and the abundance of the PBHs.\\nTherefore, we propose that along with the SGWB created directly by the creation mechanisms\\nof PBH, (scalar perturbations, cosmic strings, FOPT, inflation, etc.) the SGWB created by\\nthose PBHs are also the consequence of those mechanisms. Therefore, the features of the\\ncumulative SGWB is unique up to the mechanism that is responsible for the origin of PBH.\\nTo illustrate this further, the mass and abundance of the PBHs created during a FOPT\\ndepend on the specifics of the FOPT, i.e. the strength (α), duration (1/β), energy content,\\ncritical temperature (Tcri) etc. The SGWB produced due to the FOPT also depend on these\\nsame parameters. Therefore, the spectrum of the SGWB from the FOPT and the spectrum\\nof the SGWB from the PBH interactions depend on the specifics of the FOPT directly and\\nindirectly, respectively.\\nThe literature on probing the PBHs utilising the features in the gravitational waves\\nis quite large [22, 43–55]. However, an approach to study the cumulative effect of the GW\\nbackground from the creation mechanism of PBH as well as the gravitational interactions\\nof the PBHs is yet to be rigorously performed. In this article, we tried to fill that gap by\\ninvestigating the sum of the SGWB due the FOPT and the SGWB due the interactions of\\nPBH as prescription to test the claim that FOPTs are the origin of PBHs. In principle, this\\ncan be extended to all the other mechanisms which create both PBH and SGWB. Recently\\nin Refs. [43, 53] it was proposed that SGWB spectra can be used to distinguish between\\ncreation mechanism of PBH; though the SGWB due to gravitational interactions of PBHs\\nwere not considered since for those mass ranges of PBH it would have been insignificant.\\nSince we are considering gravitational interactions of the PBHs as one of the sources of\\nSGWB, the mass of the PBHs are to be large enough for the SGWB to be significant. This\\nled us to consider specific FOPTs, i.e. the FOPTs for which the transition temperature is\\nbelow O(10 GeV) as examples which can generate PBHs with large masses, i.e. masses above\\nO(10−5M⊙). These comparatively low temperature FOPTs can be motivated from the dark\\nsector phase transitions [56]. Owing to the larger mass, in this article we deal with PBHs for\\nwhich Hawking evaporation [57] does not play any major role. These PBHs are also created\\nduring the radiation dominated era, and therefore the PBH-PBH interactions in principle\\nhave started from a very early time in the universe, but the PBH-ABH interactions could\\nhave started only after the creation the of the first ABHs. We have taken these effects into\\naccount in our study as well. Furthermore, we also look into the dependence of the peak\\nfrequencies of the cumulative spectrum on the temperature at which the FOPT occurred. We\\nalso show the cumulative SGWB originating from FOPTs at different temperatures where\\nsome benchmark values of the relevant parameters have been used.\\nThis article is organized as follows, in Sec. 2 we discuss FOPT as the common origin\\nof SGWB and the PBHs. After discussing the mass and abundance of PBHs formed out of\\nFOPT we go on to show the SGWB spectrum that can be originating from the FOPT. In\\nSec. 3 we discuss the SGWB spectrum originating from PBH-PBH interactions which can be\\nof two main classes, namely the binary formations and closed hyperbolic encounters. Similar\\ninteractions can, in principle occur between PBH and ABH as well. The SGWB spectrum\\nfrom out of PBH-ABH interactions is discussed in Sec. 4. We present our results in Sec. 5\\nand finally summarize and conclude in Sec. 6.\\n– 2 –\\n2 FOPT as the Origin of the PBH and GW\\nMany different processes have been considered for the creation of PBHs with mass and\\nabundance ranging throughout the parameter space. In this article we consider the creation\\nof PBH from the collapse of overdense region during a first order phase transition. Here we\\nconsider the mechanisms proposed in [27–30].\\nDuring its evolution as the temperature decreased, the universe might have gone through\\nseveral phase transitions. These phase transitions are characterized by the potential of the\\norder parameter that drives the transition. These phase transitions could be of first or\\nsecond order in nature depending on the shape of the potential. If it has a barrier between\\nthe true vacuum (newly generated global minima) and the false vacuum (pre-existing yet\\nlocal minima), then it is a first order phase transition, otherwise, it is a second order. The\\ntemperature, below which the pre-existing minima becomes a local minima and a new global\\nminima is created, is called the critical temperature, Tcri. A first order phase transition, which\\nwe are interested in here, occurs through the nucleation of true vacuum bubbles which then\\nexpand releasing huge amount of energy to the bubble walls and the surrounding plasma.\\nThe rate of the nucleation of the true vacuum is approximately given around an appropriate\\ntime t0 by [58],\\nΓ ≈ Γ0e\\nβ(t−t0) (2.1)\\nwhere,\\nβ = −dS(t)\\ndt\\n∣∣∣\\nt=t0\\n(2.2)\\nand S(t) is the bounce action of the four or three dimensional instanton solution depending on\\nthe temperature of the transition [59]. Before the universe reaches the critical temperature,\\nthe average fraction of false vacuum is unity. But as the phase transition progresses, the\\naverage fraction of false vacuum reduces depending of the specific dynamics of the phase\\ntransition. Since the nucleation of true vacuum bubble is a probabilistic process, in some\\nHubble volume, the creation of a true vacuum bubble might be delayed. The idea is that as\\nthe time passes and the universe expands, the radiation and the wall energy density in the\\nfalse vacuum region falls as ∝ a−4(t) though the vacuum energy density remains constant.\\nSoon after, the vacuum energy in the false vacuum region starts decaying into the radiation\\nand wall energy density. In the true vacuum region, since the vacuum energy density is much\\nless than that of the false vacuum region, the ratio of energy density inside and outside the\\nfalse vacuum region keeps increasing and reaches a maximum value when the entire vacuum\\nenergy inside the false vacuum region has been decayed. Once it reaches a critical value of\\n1.45, the false vacuum region collapses to form a PBH [60]. For a more in-depth explanation,\\nsee [27–30].\\nNow we briefly discuss the mass and the abundance of the PBHs arising due to different\\ncases of FOPT through the method mentioned above. In this work we consider two bench-\\nmark FOPTs, the parameters of which are provided in Tab. 1. Transitions around such kind\\nof temperatures can arise in various BSM scenarios [56, 61]. Moreover, these FOPTs would\\ngenerate masses for the PBH which are large enough for our purposes while maintaining the\\nvarious abundance constraints depicted in Fig. 1.\\n– 3 –\\nParameters I II\\nT (in GeV) 0.06 45\\nα 1 1.5\\nβ/H 3.5 2.5\\nκ 0.5 1\\nTable 1: The relevant parameters describing the different FOPTs.\\nHere κ is the fraction of vacuum energy transferred into the bubble walls. Now we will\\nuse these values to obtain the mass and the abundance of the PBHs and the gravitational\\nwaves due to collision of the bubble walls.\\n2.1 Creation of PBHs: Mass and Abundance\\nThe formation mechanism of PBHs that we are following [27–30], is based on the collapse\\nof overdense regions which are a consequence of delayed nucleation of true vacuum bubbles.\\nHowever, there are slight differences in the specifics of the creation mechanisms of [27–30],\\ni.e. the contribution of the nucleation in the past light-cone which leads to slightly different\\nabundance of PBHs for the same parameter values. It is also to be kept in mind that the\\nmass of the PBHs are dependent on the nucleation temperature and therefore is of the same\\norder for all the cases. To quantify the PBH parameters we note that the mass of the PBH\\nformed due to the above-mentioned process can approximately be given as,\\nM(t) = γ\\n4π\\n3\\nρ̄(t)H−3(t), (2.3)\\nwhere, H2(t) = ρ̄(t)/3M2\\nP, with ρ̄ is the average energy density and MP is the Planck mass.\\nHere γ (≤ 1) is a numerical factor which depends on the specifics of the gravitational collapse.\\nNow, we assume that most of the PBHs which are formed during a FOPT have a mass,\\nMPBH = M(t1.45), where t1.45 is defined by,\\nρinside(t1.45)\\nρoutside(t1.45)\\n= 1.45. (2.4)\\nUsing this prescription, the masses of PBHs formed during FOPT I and FOPT II are 40M⊙\\nand 3× 10−5M⊙ respectively.\\nSlightly different PBH abundances can be generated from similar parameter ranges [27–\\n30]. Therefore, remaining agnostic about the finer details of the mechanisms, we take two\\nbenchmark values for the PBH abundances, i.e. for the PBHs created during to FOPT I,\\nthe abundace today is 0.005 whereas for the PBHs created during the FOPT II, today’s\\nabundance is 0.01. The mass of the PBHs and their abundances along with the relevant\\nconstraints1 have been depicted in Fig. 1.\\n1Since the LVC constraints from the merger rates depend on the nature of the events, i.e. whether some\\nor all of the events are of primordial nature [62], we have not included those.\\n– 4 –\\nSubaru HSC\\nKepler\\nOGLE MACHO/EROS\\nSNe\\nLyα\\nCMB\\nO2 \\nO3a\\nFOPT II FOPT I\\n10-8 10-5 0.01 10\\n10-6\\n10-5\\n10-4\\n0.001\\n0.010\\n0.100\\n1\\nM\\nM\\nf P\\nB\\nH\\nFigure 1: Abundances for different PBH masses.

The constraints from pulsar parameter drifts (PPD) [84] have also\\nbeen shown.\\n3 PBH-PBH Interactions\\nThe PBHs after being formed during the FOPT are free to interact among themselves.\\nDepending on the initial conditions, e.g relative velocity and the scattering cross sections,\\netc., two PBHs can either form a bound binary system or there could be a single scattering\\nevent [50, 85–89]. For binary black holes (BBH) there could be three cases where different\\ntypes of GWs can be produced – (i) individual mergers which create short-lived transient\\nsignals, (ii) binaries which are in inspiraling phase create GW signals that last longer than\\nthe observational period, and (iii) binaries which are unresolvable and create SGWB [90].\\nSimilarly, individual scattering events or close hyperbolic encounters (CHE) of two PBHs\\ncan also either create transient signals or they can create SGWB. In this article, our main\\nfocus is on the SGWB spectrum created by these events.\\nAs opposed to the previous section, where the source of the SGWB spectrum was\\nconsidered to be the FOPT, here, we consider many individual unresolvable events. These\\nindividual events can be considered to be point-like. In case of a point source, the SGWB\\nspectrum is expressed as,\\nΩGW(f) =\\n1\\nρc\\ndρGW\\nd ln f\\n=\\n1\\nρc\\n∫ ∞\\n0\\ndz\\nN(z)\\n1 + z\\ndEGW\\nd ln fs\\n, (3.1)\\nwhere ρc is the critical density of the universe, fs = (1 + z)f is the GW frequency in the\\nsource frame and z is the redshift. Here N(z) is the number density of GW events, at redshift\\nz and it is given by,\\nN(z) =\\nτ(z)\\n(1 + z)H(z)\\n, (3.2)\\n– 6 –\\nwhere H(z) is the Hubble expansion coefficient and τ(z) is the number of events per unit\\ntime per unit comoving volume and it is expressed in units of yr−1Gpc−3. Now, in case of\\ndifferent mass spectrum for two different progenitor masses this is can be given as,\\nτ(z) =\\n∫ ∫\\ndm1\\nm1\\ndm2\\nm2\\ndτ\\nd lnm1d lnm2\\n. (3.3)\\nHere we consider the number of event to be independent of the redshift. The quantities\\ndEGW/d ln fs and τ(z) depend on the event type (BBH or CHE). In the next part of the\\narticle, we will focus specifically on these different type of events and generate the relevant\\nGW spectrum.\\n3.1 Binary PBH systems\\nIf the PBHs are clustered in dense halos, then their number density can be expressed as a\\ncombination of their mass function, the critical density of the universe, their masses and the\\nlocal density contrast. In case of PBH binary systems, the event rate per logarithmic mass\\ninterval takes the form [50],\\ndτBBH\\nd lnm1d lnm2\\n= 14.8 yr−1Gpc−3f(m1)f(m2)\\nM10/7\\n(m1m2)5/7\\n(\\nΩDM\\n0.25\\n)2(δloc\\n108\\n)(\\nv0\\n10 km/s\\n)−11/7\\n,\\n(3.4)\\nwhere ΩDM is the density parameter of dark matter in the universe, δloc is the local density\\ncontrast which can be considered to be O(108) [91], v0 is the initial relative velocity between\\nthe two PBHs participating in the binary formation, M = (m1+m2) is the total mass where\\nm1 and m2 are the masses of the individual masses of the PBHs and f(m1) and f(m2)\\nare the logarithmic mass function of the PBHs of masses m1 and m2 respectively such that∫\\nf(m)dm/m = fPBH where fPBH is the fraction of dark mater which is constituted of PBHs.\\nIt is to be noted that in this article we have considered the two different dimensionless Hubble\\nparameters to be h70 = 1 and h = 0.7. In this case since we consider the collapse of overdense\\nregion during a FOPT as the creation mechanism, the logarithmic mass function of the PBH\\nof mass m′ is ∝ δ(m−m′), i.e. we assume that all the PBHs created due to this mechanism\\nare of the same mass.\\nNow we consider the energy emitted as GW per frequency interval, i.e. dEGW/dfs in\\ncase of a BBH. For this purpose, we use the waveform for non-spinning binaries [92],\\ndEGW\\ndfs\\n=\\n(Gπ)2/3M\\n5/3\\nc\\n3\\n\\nf−1/3\\ns , fs ≤ fmerg\\nf−1\\nmergf\\n2/3\\ns , fmerg ≤ x ≤ fring\\nf−1\\nmergf\\n−4/3\\nring f2\\ns\\n[(\\nfs − fring\\nσ/2\\n)2\\n+ 1\\n]−2\\n, fring ≤ fs ≤ fcut\\n0, fs > fcut\\n(3.5)\\nwhere, Mc = (m1m2)\\n3/5/(m1 + m2)\\n1/5 is the chirp mass.

(3.1) to obtain SGWB spectrum for\\nthe different combinations of PBH masses. For binaries consisting of two 3×10−5M⊙ PBHs,\\nthe spectrum is insignificant, therefore we have not shown it. The other two spectrum have\\nbeen shown in Fig. 3. It can be seen that for the 40M⊙ binaries, the SGWB spectrum is well\\nwithin the reach of BBO. But for the other two cases, the SGWB spectrum is not within the\\nsensitivity of any proposed GW detector.\\n40M-40M\\n40M-3×10\\n-5M\\nBBO\\nDECIGO\\nLISA\\nTaiji\\nCE\\nET\\n0.01 1 100 104\\n10-18\\n10-17\\n10-16\\n10-15\\n10-14\\n10-13\\n10-12\\nf (Hz)\\nΩ\\nG\\nW\\n(f\\n)h\\n2\\nFigure 3: The SGWB spectrum for PBH binaries of mass combinations 40M⊙− 40M⊙ and\\n40M⊙ − 3× 10−5M⊙.

(3.7)\\nWe use this above relation in Sec. 5 in order to determine the dependence of this peak\\nfrequency on the temperature at which the FOPT occurred.\\n3.2 Close Hyperbolic Encounters of PBH\\nIn addition to the BBH scenario, as discussed previously, the PBHs can take part in close\\nhyperbolic encounters (CHE). Such encounters can also give rise to specific type of GW\\nspectrum. For the CHE, the event rate can be expressed as [50],\\nτCHE\\nd lnm1d lnm2\\n= 25.4× 10−8\\n(\\nΩDM\\n0.25\\n)2(δloc\\n108\\n)\\nf(m1)f(m2)\\nM2\\nm1m2\\ne2 − 1\\n(v0/c)3\\n, (3.8)\\nwhere e is eccentricity of the path taken by the PBH.

We use the prescription given\\nin Ref. [50] to obtain the expression for peak frequency and the SGWB spectrum. The peak\\nfrequency for the SGWB due to the CHEs of the PBHs takes the form [50],\\nfpeak ∼ 43 Hz\\n( y\\n0.01\\n)−3\\n(\\nM\\n200 M⊙\\n)1/2 ( a\\n0.1 AU\\n)−3/2\\n, (3.10)\\nand the associated SGWB spectrum takes the form,\\nΩGW(f) = 9.81× 10−13\\n(\\nΩDM\\n0.25\\n)2(δloc\\n108\\n)( a\\n0.1 AU\\n)(\\nf\\n10 Hz\\n)2 ( y\\n0.01\\n)\\n×\\n∫\\ndm1\\n100 M⊙\\ndm2\\n100 M⊙\\nf(m1)f(m2)e\\n−2x0ζ(y)Ĩ(y, x0), (3.11)\\nhere we have used density parameter of matter in the universe, ΩM = 0.3. The quantities\\nx0, ζ(y), Ĩ(y, x0) are defined in Ref. [50].\\nUsing these expressions we have obtained the SGWB spectrum for CHEs of the different\\ncombinations of the PBH masses. As expected, similar to the case of BBHs, here also, the\\nCHEs between two PBHs of mass 3 × 10−5M⊙ are insignificant and we have not shown\\nit. The SGWB spectrum for the other two mass combinations have been shown in Fig. 4.\\nIt is to be noted that the spectrum for the CHEs between two 40M⊙ PBHs are within the\\nsensitivity curves of BBO and DECIGO, but the spectrum due to the CHEs between a 40M⊙\\nand a 3× 10−5M⊙ is not within the sensitivity curves of any of the futuristic or current GW\\ndetection experiments.\\n– 9 –\\n40M-40M\\n40M-3×10\\n-5M\\nBBO\\nDECIGO\\nCE\\nET\\n0.1 1 10 100 1000\\n10-18\\n10-17\\n10-16\\n10-15\\n10-14\\n10-13\\n10-12\\nf (Hz)\\nΩ\\nG\\nW\\n(f\\n)h\\n2\\nFigure 4: The SGWB spectrum for close hyperbolic encounters of PBHs of mass combina-\\ntions 40M⊙−40M⊙ and 40M⊙−3×10−5M⊙.

The\\nrelevant sensitivity curves have been shown.\\n4 PBH-ABH Interactions\\nIf PBHs exist, then there should necessarily be the PBH-ABH interactions [51, 94] which\\nshould consist of both bound PBH-ABH systems and also single scattering events. In the\\nsubsequent section of the article, we take both of them into account and consider the respec-\\ntive GW spectrum.\\n4.1 PBH-ABH Binary Systems\\nFirst we take up the case of PBH-ABH binaries and how they contribute to the SGWB\\nspectrum. In order to obtain the SGWB spectrum, we use the approach similar to Sec. 3.\\nThe averaged number of ABH per solar mass of stellar objects turns out to be ∼ 2×10−3 [51].\\nThe merger rate for PBH-ABH binaries per logarithmic mass interval can be expressed as [91],\\ndτBBH\\nd lnm1d lnm2\\n=\\n1\\nδloc\\nσBBHvBHnA(mA)nP (mP ), (4.1)\\nwhere nA is the number density of the ABHs, nP is the number density of the PBHs, and\\nvBH = v0/\\n√\\n2, where v0 is the initial relative velocity between the PBH and the ABH. Here,\\nσBBH is the cross section of the interactions between ABH and PBH in case of the formation\\nof a binary which is given by [95],\\nσBBH = π\\n(\\n340π\\n3\\n)2/7 G2M10/7(m1m2)\\n2/7\\nc10/7v\\n18/7\\n0\\n. (4.2)\\nFor our numerical analysis, we assume that ABH mass have ranges from 5M⊙ to a few tens\\nof solar masses [96, 97]. In this case, irrespective of when the PBH formation took place,\\nthe formation of binaries can only start after the creation of the first ABH. Therefore, unlike\\nEq. (3.1), one can not take the upper-limit of the redshift integration to be infinite. For the\\n– 10 –\\npurposes of this work, we have considered the upper limit of the redshift for the PBH-ABH\\ninteractions to be 5 [51]. Hence, Eq. (3.1) takes a modified form,\\nΩGW(f) =\\n1\\nρc\\n∫ 5\\n0\\ndz\\nN(z)\\n1 + z\\ndEGW\\nd ln fs\\n. (4.3)\\nNow we use Eqs. (4.1) and (4.2) in Eqs. (3.2) and (4.3) to obtain the SGWB spectrum for\\nPBH-ABH binaries. In Fig. 5 we have shown the SGWB spectrum for PBH-ABH binaries\\nwith PBH mass 40M⊙ and 3 × 10−5M⊙. Again as expected, it can be seen that for 40M⊙\\nPBHs, the SGWB spectrum due to the PBH-ABH binaries are within the reach of BBO,\\nwhereas for 3 × 10−5M⊙ PBHs, the PBH-ABH binaries create SGWB which is too faint to\\nbe detected by any of the proposed detectors.\\n40M PBH-ABH\\n3×10-5M PBH-ABH\\nBBO\\nDECIGO\\nLISA\\nTaiji\\nCE\\nET\\n0.01 1 100 104\\n10-18\\n10-17\\n10-16\\n10-15\\n10-14\\n10-13\\n10-12\\nf (Hz)\\nΩ\\nG\\nW\\n(f\\n)h\\n2\\nFigure 5: The SGWB spectrum for PBH-ABH binaries for PBH mass 40 M⊙ and 3 ×\\n10−5M⊙.

In order to obtain the SGWB spectrum due to the PBH-ABH CHE, we follow\\na prescription similar to that of PBH-PBH CHE. In this case, the main difference is the\\nnumber density of the ABHs which has been explained in the previous sub-section. Taking\\nthat into account, we have generated the SGWB spectrum for PBH-ABH CHE for both\\nthe PBH masses considered in this article and they have been shown in Fig. 6. It is to be\\nnoted that for the CHEs of 40M⊙ PBHs with the ABHs, the SGWB is marginally within\\nthe sensitivity curve of BBO, but in case of 3× 10−5M⊙ PBHs, the resultant SGWB is well\\nbeyond the reach of any of the proposed GW detectors. This is again consistent with the\\nbasic expectation that more massive encounters will lead to GW with larger peak frequencies.\\n– 11 –\\n40M PBH-ABH\\n3×10-5M PBH-ABH\\nBBO\\nDECIGO\\nCE\\nET\\n0.1 1 10 100\\n10-18\\n10-17\\n10-16\\n10-15\\n10-14\\n10-13\\n10-12\\nf (Hz)\\nΩ\\nG\\nW\\n(f\\n)h\\n2\\nFigure 6: The SGWB spectrum for PBH-ABH close hyperbolic encounters for PBH mass\\n40M⊙ and 3× 10−5M⊙.

The relevant sensitivity curves have\\nbeen shown.\\n5 Results\\nIn this article, we consider a situation where PBHs are generated due to the cosmological\\nFOPTs, therefore along with the SGWB signal generated directly through the bubble wall\\ncollisions during the FOPT, the SGWB signals due the interactions of these PBHs among\\nthemselves and with other ABHs are also indirectly a consequence of the FOPT. So, we look\\nat the sum of all these SGWB signals, which we call the cumulative background spectrum.\\nWe present our results in two main sections. First we elaborate on the cumulative\\nstochastic background due to a first order phase transition and then we focus on the peak\\nfrequencies of the different components of the cumulative background and their dependence\\non the transition temperature. Along with this, we also look at the dependence of the\\ncumulative background on the temperature of the FOPT.\\n5.1 Cumulative Background\\nAs we have seen in Sec. 3, the SGWB originating from the PBH binary systems and the\\nsingle scattering events are only significant and detectable by the future GW detectors for\\nthe cases where two 40M⊙ interacts with each other or where 40M⊙ PBH interacts with\\nABH. Therefore, in this part, we just focus on that result, i.e. the SGWB from the FOPT\\nat 60 MeV and the SGWB from the interactions of the PBHs created during this FOPT.\\nAs it can be seen from Fig. 7, the peak of the spectrum originating from the FOPT\\nis within the reach of the SKA and the PTAs and the tail part of it is within the reach\\nof LISA, Taiji, BBO and DECIGO. The spectrum originating from the PBH-PBH CHE is\\nwithin the reach of BBO but the spectrum due to the PBH-ABH CHE is not within the reach\\nof any GW detectors. Here, it is also to be noted that the spectrum due to both of these\\ntwo falls in the same frequency region and due to fact that the amplitude of the spectrum\\ndue to the PBH-PBH CHE is much larger than that of the PBH-ABH CHE, the former\\ncompletely overshadows the later. Therefore, for our subsequent analysis, we will only be\\n– 12 –\\nFOPT\\nPBH BBH\\nPBH CHE\\nPBH-ABH BBH\\nPBH-ABH CHE\\nSKA\\nIPTA\\nPPTA\\nEPTA\\nLISA\\nTaiji\\nBBO\\nDECIGO\\nCE\\nET\\nLVK\\n10-8 10-6 10-4 0.01 1 100\\n10-18\\n10-16\\n10-14\\n10-12\\n10-10\\n10-8\\n10-6\\nf (Hz)\\nΩ\\nG\\nW\\n(f\\n)h\\n2\\nFigure 7: The SGWB spectrums originating from different processes for FOPT at T =\\n60 MeV which corresponds to the PBHs of mass 40M⊙.\\nconsidering the spectrum originating due to the PBH-PBH CHE. Similarly, for the case of\\nPBH-PBH and PBH-ABH BBH, it is to be noted that both the spectrum has almost similar\\nshape with respect to the frequencies, but the amplitude of the PBH-PBH BBH SGWB\\nspectrum is slightly higher than that of PBH-ABH BBH in the region where detection is\\npossible, which is why we ignore the spectrum originating from the PBH-ABH binaries in\\nthe following subsection as it will not contribute to the net SGWB spectrum in a significant\\nmanner. Some part of the PBH-PBH BBH spectrum is within the sensitivity curve of the\\nBBO, but the peak part of it is in the higher frequency region of the spectrum and thus\\nit is inaccessible through BBO and DECIGO. Also, the amplitude is not large enough for\\nit to be detectable through ET and CE. These two issues arise due to the temperature of\\nthe FOPT that creates these PBHs as there is a direct dependence of the PBH mass on the\\nFOPT temperature. The peak frequency and the amplitude of the GW spectrum has a direct\\ndependence on the PBH mass. Hence, our focus needs to be shifted to the dependence of\\nthese quantities on the transition temperature.\\n5.2 Transition Temperature and Peak Frequencies\\nThe mass of the PBH created during the radiation dominated era due to the collapse of a\\nregion of the size of the Hubble horizon can be expressed as [98],\\nM = 1.45× 105\\n( g∗\\n10.75\\n)−1/2\\n(\\nT\\nMeV\\n)−2\\nM⊙, (5.1)\\nwhere g∗ is the relativistic degrees of freedom at temperature T . Therefore, from Eq. (3.7) we\\ncan write the peak frequency for the SGWB originating from binary PBH systems where the\\n– 13 –\\nCHE\\nFOPT\\nBBH\\n1 10 100 1000 104\\n10-11\\n10-6\\n0.1\\n104\\nT(MeV)\\nf p\\nea\\nk(\\nH\\nz)\\nFigure 8: The dependences of the peak frequencies of the SGWB spectrum originating from\\ndifferent sources on the temperature of the FOPT.\\nmasses of both the participating PBHs are the same as a function of transition temperature,\\nfBBH\\npeak = 0.12\\n( g∗\\n10.75\\n)1/2\\n(\\nT\\nMeV\\n)\\nHz. (5.2)\\nSimilarly, for the spectrum originating from the CHE of PBHs, using Eq. (3.10), the peak\\nfrequency can be expressed as a function of the transition temperature as,\\nfCHE\\npeak = 46\\n( g∗\\n10.75\\n)−1/4\\n(\\nT\\nMeV\\n)\\nHz, (5.3)\\nwhere we have taken the benchmark values for the parameters a and y to be 7 × 104 AU\\nand 3.5 × 10−5 respectively. Therefore, from Eqs. (2.6), (5.2) and (5.3) we have shown the\\ntransition temperature dependence of the peak frequencies in Fig. 8. In generating this\\nFig. 8 we have used the benchmark value β/H = 3.5 and we have used g∗ = 10.75 for\\nT < 100 MeV and g∗ = 61.25 for 100 MeV < T < 1 GeV. We can see from this figure that,\\nthe peak frequency from the GW spectrum due to the BBH and due to the FOPT increases\\nas the transition temperature increases, whereas for the GW spectrum originating from the\\nCHEs, the peak frequency decreases with increasing transition temperature. It is also to be\\nnoted that with the sensitivity reach of different GW detection experiments, signals with\\nfrequency ranging from 10−9 Hz to 103 Hz can be detected. Therefore, from Fig. 8 we can\\nsee that, if the amplitude of the signal is high enough, then from transition temperature\\n50 MeV to approximately 10 GeV, the peak frequency region of all three signals can be\\ndetected, whereas for temperatures lower than that, the peaks of GW signals originating\\nfrom only BBH and CHE, can be detected. In these cases, even though the peak region of\\nthe SGWB spectrum due to the FOPT may not be in the detectable range, most of the tail\\npart will be detectable through the various proposed GW detectors. So, we shift our focus to\\nthe complete cumulative background signals for different transition temperatures in order to\\nunderstand the detectability of the cumulative SGWB signals from FOPTs. We have shown\\nthe cumulative backgrounds for three different FOPTs with transition temperatures 16 MeV,\\n– 14 –\\nTFOPT=60 MeV\\nTFOPT=16 MeV\\nTFOPT=200 MeV\\nEPTA\\nPPTA\\nIPTA\\nSKA\\nTaiji\\nLISA\\nDECIGO\\nBBO\\nLVK\\nET\\nCE\\n10-7 10-4 0.1 100\\n10-18\\n10-16\\n10-14\\n10-12\\n10-10\\n10-8\\n10-6\\nf (Hz)\\nΩ\\nC\\num\\nul\\nat\\niv\\ne-\\nG\\nW\\n(f\\n)h\\n2\\nFigure 9: The cumulative SGWB spectra originating due to FOPTs at different tempera-\\ntures.\\n60 MeV and 200 MeV in Fig. 9. In this case, we have taken the benchmark parameters to\\nbe α = 1, β/H = 3.5, κ = 0.5, a = 7 × 104 AU, y = 3.5 × 10−5 and fPBH = 0.005. It is\\nto be noted that, lower the temperature of the FOPT, higher the masses of the PBHs, and\\ntherefore higher is the peak in the tail part of the cumulative signal as that consists of the\\nsignals from the BBHs and the CHEs. It is also to be seen that the peak of the tail end of\\nthe cumulative signal for the FOPT occurring at T = 60 MeV is inaccessible through CE,\\nET and DECIGO, but that is not the case for the FOPT at T = 16 MeV, where the peak of\\nthe tail end is within the reach of DECIGO, BBO, ET, and CE. Also, the peak region of the\\ntail end of the cumulative signal due to the FOPT occurring at T = 200 MeV is the lowest\\namong the three, as expected.\\nIt is to be noted that for the cumulative SGWB spectrum shown in Fig. 9, the first\\npeak occurs around O(10−9 Hz) while the second peak occurs around O(1 Hz). In the other\\ntwo cases as well, the peaks are separated by O(1011 Hz) and O(1010 Hz) respectively. This\\nvery high separation between the peaks makes this signal unique when compared with other\\nexotic SGWB signals with multiple peaks arising from different mechanisms [22, 99–101].\\n6 Summary and Conclusion\\nThe central aim of this article is to obtain a prescription to test the claim of creation of\\nPBH during a first order phase transition. In this work, we consider the SGWB from FOPTs\\nand the BBH and CHE of PBHs due to interactions with other PBHs and ABHs. We note\\nthat the procedure can easily be extended to other mechanisms which create both PBH and\\nSGWB.\\n– 15 –\\nWe have considered two characteristic FOPTs at temperatures 45 GeV and 60 MeV and\\nobtain the mass and taken benchmark abundance of the PBHs which can be expressed as\\n{3× 10−5M⊙, 0.01} and {40M⊙, 0.005}, respectively. Along with this we obtain the SGWB\\ndue to these FOPTs. It is to be noted here, that since we are considering non-spinning PBHs\\nwith comparatively high masses, gravitational interactions are the only major source through\\nwhich the secondary SGWB spectrum could arise. This is because of the fact that due to\\nthe heavy mass Hawking evaporation does not play any major role and due to non-spinning\\nnature of the PBHs superradiance is immaterial. We leave the discussion of cumulative\\nSGWB due to lighter and spinning PBHs for future work. Then we consider the interaction\\nbetween PBHs. At first we focus on the SGWB from PBH-PBH binaries for the all the three\\npossible combinations, i.e. two 40M⊙ PBHs, one 40M⊙ PBH-one 3× 10−5M⊙ PBH and two\\n3×10−5M⊙ PBHs. From this, we can see that interactions between two 40M⊙ PBHs creates a\\nSGWB spectrum that can be detected through BBO, whereas for the other two combinations,\\nthe spectrum is too weak for even any future GW detectors. We consider the SGWB spectrum\\ndue to close hyperbolic interactions between PBHs for the same three combinations of PBH\\nmasses. In this case also, we see that for the first PBHmass combination, the resultant SGWB\\nspectrum can be probed through BBO and DECIGO, but the other two combinations can\\nnot be probed by any of the proposed detectors. For completeness we also consider the\\nPBH-ABH binaries and PBH-ABH close hyperbolic interactions for both the PBH masses.\\nIn this case, we see that SGWB spectrum due to the 40M⊙ PBH interaction with ABH\\n(both binaries and CHEs) can be probed through BBO, but the signal will be too faint\\nin case of the 3 × 10−5M⊙ for any of the detectors to detect them. It can also be seen\\nthat, the spectrum for the interactions of 40M⊙ PBHs overshadows the spectrum due to the\\ninteractions between the 40M⊙ PBHs and ABHs. Therefore, we have only considered the\\nresults for the interactions between the 40M⊙ PBHs. It is also to be noted that we have\\nconsidered benchmark values for CHE in both PBH-PBH and PBH-ABH cases. A detailed\\nanalysis regarding the distribution of PBH and ABH will lead to a more realistic and wide\\nparameter space for those variables.\\nWe show the cumulative SGWB due to FOPT and various gravitational interactions of\\nthe PBHs. We consider that these PBHs are created due to the FOPT, therefore the SGWB\\nspectrum generated through the interactions of the PBHs are also an indirect consequence of\\nthe FOPT itself. Hence, we represent the the sum of all these spectrum as a single cumulative\\nspectrum due to the FOPT. We see that, along with the peak due to the SGWB from the\\nFOPT in the nHz region, secondary peaks also arise around the 1 − 100 Hz region, some\\nof which could be probed through BBO. A spectrum which spans such a large frequency\\nrange and can be detected at different frequencies through different proposed GW detection\\nexperiment is unique. Therefore, the detection of a signal of this nature will be a strong\\nindication that FOPTs are indeed the generators of PBH.\\nWe also investigate the dependence of these different peak frequencies on the temper-\\nature at which the FOPT occurs. In this investigation, we found that the peak due to the\\nFOPT increases linearly with the transition temperature, the peak frequency for the binaries\\nis proportional to the square of the transition temperature, whereas the peak frequency due\\nto the CHE is inversely proportional to the temperature. In order to understand the tem-\\nperature dependence of the cumulative spectrum better, we have presented the cumulative\\nSGWB spectrum due to three different FOPTs occurring at temperatures 16 MeV, 60 MeV\\nand 200 MeV. We have taken some benchmark values for the other relevant parameters in\\norder to generate the cumulative spectrum. We can see from these three cumulative spec-\\n– 16 –\\ntrum, that as the temperature is lower, higher the chances are for the secondary peaks to\\nbe in the detection range of the future detectors. In future we would like to study the dark\\nsector FOPTs in details which can lead to FOPTs at temperatures O(10 MeV). This could\\ngive us a more detailed idea regarding some more intricate details of the spectrum and it will\\nalso tell us about other consequences of such models.\\nIn conclusion, we propose that future detection of a spectrum of this kind with multiple\\ndetectable peaks spanning a large frequency range will provide crucial information about the\\ncreation mechanism of PBH through first order cosmological phase transitions.\\nAcknowledgments\\nIKB thanks Bandita Das for useful discussions.

Here's a critical evaluation followed by suggestions for improvement:\n\n### Critical Evaluation\n\n1. **Formation Mechanisms:**\n   - The hypothesis correctly mentions density fluctuations in the early universe as a mechanism for black hole formation.\n   - It also includes primordial black holes (PBHs) specifically, which is accurate.\n\n2. **Mass Range:**\n   - The mass range provided (\\(10^{-24}\\) kg to several solar masses) is reasonable and aligns with the current understanding of PBHs.\n   \n3. **Probes for Quantum Gravity Effects:**\n   - The hypothesis correctly identifies PBHs as potential probes for quantum gravity effects via Hawking radiation, which is a key point from the research paper.\n\n4. **Observational Constraints:**\n   - The hypothesis mentions observational constraints such as CMB anisotropies, large-scale structure, and gravitational wave observations.\n   - However, it could be more specific about how these constraints are applied to PBHs.\n\n5. **Dark Matter Candidates:**\n   - The inclusion of dark matter candidates is a good addition but could benefit from further elaboration on the connection between PBHs and dark matter.\n\n### Suggestions for Improvement\n\n1. **Clarify the Mass Range:**\n   - Provide more specific mass ranges, e.g., \"from \\(10^{-24}\\) kg to 10 solar masses,\" which is a commonly discussed range in literature.\n   \n2. **Expand on Probes for Quantum Gravity Effects:**\n   - Mention that PBHs can be used as probes by studying their evaporation processes and the resulting radiation, which could provide insights into quantum gravity effects.\n\n3. **Enhance Observational Constraints:**\n   - Specify how CMB anisotropies, large-scale structure, and gravitational wave observations are used to constrain the mass function of PBHs.\n   \n4. **Elaborate on Dark Matter Candidates:**\n   - Explain that if PBHs were found to be a significant component of dark matter, it would have profound implications for our understanding of both black holes and dark matter.\n\n5. **Add Contextual Information:**\n   - Provide context about the significance of studying PBHs in relation to fundamental physics questions, such as the unification of general relativity and quantum mechanics.\n\n### Revised Hypothesis\n\nHere's a revised version incorporating these suggestions:\n\n**Revised Hypothesis:** The formation of black holes, particularly primordial black holes (PBHs), can occur through density fluctuations in the early universe, leading to a wide range of masses from \\(10^{-24}\\) kg to 10 solar masses. These PBHs could serve as probes for testing quantum gravity effects via their evaporation processes such as Hawking radiation. The mass function of PBHs is constrained by various observational data including CMB anisotropies, large-scale structure, and gravitational wave observations. Specifically, the CMB can provide constraints on the abundance of PBHs through their imprint on the primordial power spectrum, while large-scale structure studies can probe the effects of PBHs on the growth of cosmic structures. Additionally, if PBHs were found to be a significant component of dark matter, it would have profound implications for our understanding of both black holes and dark matter.\n\nThis revised hypothesis is more comprehensive and provides clearer connections between different aspects of the research discussed in the paper."},"done_reason":"stop","done":true,"total_duration":431809679017,"load_duration":13411524,"prompt_eval_count":458,"prompt_eval_duration":22483917035,"eval_count":761,"eval_duration":409307184597}
