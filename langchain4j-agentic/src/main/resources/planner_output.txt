The last response is empty, so no previous actions.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out which agent to call next. The user's request is about a medical issue—breaking a leg. The categorizeRequest agent is meant to categorize the request, so maybe that's the first step. But wait, the user is directly asking for advice on what to do, which is a medical concern. However, the instructions say to query all necessary agents. Wait, no, the user says to use all agents if needed, but in this case, the request is straightforward. But according to the rules, even if the request is clear, I must use all agents. Wait, no, the user said \"You MUST query ALL necessary agents.\" So maybe the categorizeRequest is needed first to determine the category, then the medical agent. But the user's request is already clear as a medical issue. However, the instructions say to never take shortcuts and use all agents. Wait, maybe the categorizeRequest agent is needed to classify the request, then the medical agent can provide the answer. But the user's request is directly a medical question. However, the system might require categorizing first. Let me check the agents again. The categorizeRequest agent's description is to categorize the user request. So perhaps the first step is to categorize the request, then proceed. But the user's request is already clear. However, the instructions say to use all necessary agents. Wait, maybe the categorizeRequest is needed to determine which agent to use. But the user's request is about a broken leg, which is medical. So maybe the categorizeRequest agent would categorize it as medical, then the medical agent can be called. But the user's request is already a medical request. However, the system requires using all agents. Wait, the user's instruction says \"You MUST query ALL necessary agents.\" So perhaps the categorizeRequest is the first step. Let me think again. The user's request is \"I broke my leg what should I do.\" The categorizeRequest agent would process this and determine it's a medical request. Then, the medical agent would be called. But the user might need immediate action. However, according to the rules, even if the request is clear, all agents must be queried. Wait, no, the user said \"Even if the user's request is already clear or explicit, don't make any assumption and use all agents.\" So in this case, even though the request is clear, we need to use all agents. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Maybe the categorizeRequest is the first step to categorize the request, then the medical agent is called. But the user's request is already a medical request. However, the system requires using all agents. Wait, perhaps the categorizeRequest is needed first. Let me check the available agents again. The categorizeRequest agent takes the request as an argument. So the first step is to call categorizeRequest with the user's request. Then, based on the categorization, the next agent is chosen. But the user's request is already clear. However, the system requires using all agents. Wait, maybe the categorizeRequest is the first step. So the correct agent to call next is categorizeRequest with the request as the argument. Then, after categorization, the medical agent would be called. But the user's request is already a medical issue. However, the system requires using all agents. Wait, maybe the categorizeRequest is needed to determine the category, then the medical agent is used. So the first step is to call categorizeRequest.

*** ResponseScore{score1=1.0, score2=0.3}
Thank you for reaching out with your concern about breaking your leg. From a medical perspective, here's what you should do:

1. **Stop Any Activity**: Immediately stop any physical activity that might worsen the injury.

2. **Immobilize the Leg**: If possible, keep the injured leg still and avoid moving it to prevent further damage. You can use a splint or a makeshift brace if available, but ensure not to apply anything too tight as this could cut off circulation.

3. **Apply Ice**: Apply ice wrapped in a cloth or an ice pack to the affected area for 15-20 minutes every few hours during the first 48 hours. This can help reduce swelling and pain.

4. **Elevate the Leg**: Try to keep your leg elevated above heart level when you are sitting or lying down, which can also help with reducing swelling.

5. **Pain Management**: Over-the-counter pain relievers such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen may be taken according to the instructions on the label to manage pain and inflammation.

6. **Seek Medical Attention**: It is crucial to seek medical attention as soon as possible, especially if you suspect a fracture. A healthcare provider will assess your injury, possibly take X-rays, and determine the appropriate treatment plan which could include casting, splinting, or other interventions depending on the severity of the break.

Remember, these steps are general guidelines and may not cover all scenarios. Immediate medical evaluation is essential to ensure proper care and prevent complications.
