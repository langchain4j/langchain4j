/**
 * Assertions on what an AI Service did: which tools were executed, with which arguments and in which order, which
 * sources were retrieved, how many times the chat model and the other models were called, why the response finished
 * and whether the invocation succeeded. These assertions are deterministic: they do not call a model. To check
 * the response text with natural-language criteria, using a model as a judge, see {@link Judge}.
 * <p>
 * Capture the invocation with {@link AiServiceCapture}, which works with any AI Service method:
 * <pre>{@code
 * import static dev.langchain4j.test.LangChain4jAssertions.assertThat;
 *
 * AiServiceCapture capture = AiServiceCapture.capture(() -> assistant.chat("Cancel my booking MS-777"));
 *
 * assertThat(capture)
 *         .hasToolsExecutedExactlyInAnyOrder("getBookingDetails", "cancelBooking")
 *         .hasToolExecutedWith("cancelBooking", Map.of("bookingNumber", "MS-777"))
 *         .hasNoFailedToolExecutions();
 * }</pre>
 * This works for every return type of the AI Service method, also {@code Result<...>}: capture the call.
 * <p>
 * {@link #hasToolExecuted(String)}, {@link #hasToolExecutedTimes(String, int)},
 * {@link #hasToolsExecutedInOrder(String...)}, {@link #hasToolsExecutedExactlyInAnyOrder(String...)} and
 * both {@code hasToolExecutedWith(...)} count only the tool executions that succeeded. A tool that threw an
 * exception counts as a failed execution, also when the AI Service sent the error to the model and then succeeded:
 * check it with
 * {@link #hasToolExecutionFailed(String)} or {@link #hasNoFailedToolExecutions()}. They fail if the AI Service did not
 * report whether its tool executions failed (see {@link ToolExecutedEvent#isError()}).
 * <p>
 * When the invocation started other AI Service invocations (for example an AI Service called by one of its tools, see
 * {@link AiServiceInvocation#nestedInvocations()}), say which ones to check first: {@link #includingNested()} checks
 * the whole tree, {@link #topLevelOnly()} only what the invocation did itself. Without it, the assertions on tools,
 * sources and model calls fail, because both readings are plausible and a wrong one could hide a
 * problem: a sub-agent that ran a forbidden tool, or called the model many times. An invocation without nested invocations needs
 * neither.
 * <p>
 * Like Mockito's {@code verifyNoMoreInteractions}, {@link #hasNoMoreToolExecutions()} checks that every tool
 * execution was checked by a tool assertion before, also by an earlier {@code assertThat(...)} on the same capture:
 * <pre>{@code
 * assertThat(capture).hasToolExecutedWith("cancelBooking", Map.of("bookingNumber", "MS-777"));
 * assertThat(capture).hasToolExecuted("getBookingDetails").hasNoMoreToolExecutions();
 * }</pre>
 * <p>
 * When an assertion fails, the message names the AI Service method and lists all executed tools with their
 * arguments and results.
 * All assertions fail if the invocation was cancelled. If the invocation failed, they fail until
 * {@link #hasFailedWithMessageContaining(String)} or {@link #hasFailedWith(Class)} has checked the failure; after
 * it, they check what happened before the failure.
 * <p>
 * These assertions need the {@code langchain4j} module, where AI Services are defined. {@code langchain4j-test}
 * does not bring it in. If the compiler reports that a class of {@code dev.langchain4j.service} is not found, add it,
 * with the same version as your other LangChain4j modules (managed by {@code langchain4j-bom} if you import it):
 * <pre>{@code
 * <dependency>
 *     <groupId>dev.langchain4j</groupId>
 *     <artifactId>langchain4j</artifactId>
 * </dependency>
 * }</pre>
