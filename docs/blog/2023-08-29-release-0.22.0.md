LangChain4j 0.22.0 is out!

- Integration with [Google Vertex AI](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai)
- Offline text classification with embeddings
- Reworked document splitters
- In-process embedding models can now embed longer texts
- In-memory embedding store can now be easily persisted
- And more: https://github.com/langchain4j/langchain4j/releases/tag/0.22.0

Now any text (e.g. document, message from a user, etc) can be classified completely offline and without any external
calls.

See example [here](https://github.com/langchain4j/langchain4j-examples/blob/main/other-examples/src/main/java/embedding/classification/EmbeddingModelTextClassifierExample.java).

You only need to specify some examples for each label/category and that's it! BTW, examples can be generated using
LLMs ;)

Benefits are: faster and cheaper usage of LLMs.

There are lots of use cases:

1. Labeling documents
2. For chatbots: choosing appropriate (system) prompt depending on the user's message (e.g. is it a complaint? a
   greeting? regular question? etc)
3. For chatbots/agents: choosing appropriate tools depending on a user's message (to save on tokens)
