# Helidon Integration

[Helidon](https://helidon.io/) provides a LangChain4j integration module that simplifies building AI-driven applications while leveraging Helidonâ€™s programming model and style.

You can find the detailed explanation and usage of LangChain4j integration feature [here](https://helidon.io/docs/latest/se/integrations/langchain4j/langchain4j).

## Supported versions

Helidon's LangChain4j integration requires Java 21 and Helidon 4.2.

## Examples

We have created several sample applications for you to explore. These samples demonstrate all aspects of using LangChain4j in Helidon applications.

### Coffee Shop Assistant
The Coffee Shop Assistant is a demo application that showcases how to build an AI-powered assistant for a coffee shop. This assistant can answer questions about the menu, provide recommendations, and create orders. It utilizes an embedding store initialized from a JSON file.

Key features:
- Integration with OpenAI chat models
- Utilization of embedding models, an embedding store, an ingestor, and a content retriever
- Helidon Inject for dependency injection
- Embedding store initialization from a JSON file
- Support for callback functions to enhance interactions
