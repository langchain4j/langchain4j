This section will walk you through all LangChain4j functionality, in steps of increasing complexity.

We will typically use OpenAI models for demonstration purposes, but we support a lot of other model providers too. The entire list of supported models can be found [here](/docs/category/integrations).

### Need inspiration?

Watch the talk [Java Meets AI: A Hands On Guide to Building LLM Powered Applications with LangChain4j](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BD1MSLbs9KE) by [Lize Raes](https://github.com/LizeRaes) at Devoxx Belgium, or consider some of the following use cases:

- You want to implement a custom AI-powered chatbot that has access to your data and behaves the way you want it:
    - Customer support chatbot that can:
        - politely answer customer questions
        - take /change/cancel orders
    - Educational assistant that can:
        - Teach various subjects
        - Explain unclear parts
        - Assess user's understanding/knowledge
- You want to process a lot of unstructured data (files, web pages, etc) and extract structured information from them.
  For example:
    - extract insights from customer reviews and support chat history
    - extract interesting information from the websites of your competitors
    - extract insights from CVs of job applicants
- You want to generate information, for example:
    - Emails tailored for each of your customers
    - Content for your app/website:
        - Blog posts
        - Stories
- You want to transform information, for example:
    - Summarize
    - Proofread and rewrite
    - Translate
