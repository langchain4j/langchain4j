# Infinispan

Infinispan is an open-source (Apache 2) in-memory key-value database and cache, can hold nearly any type of data, from plain-text 
to structured objects, is designed for high performance, scalability, and low-latency data access. 
It supports both embedded and client-server modes, allowing applications to 
use it as a local cache or a remote server database. 

Infinispan is built in Java and provides features such as persistence, transactions, 
querying (full-text and vector search included), clustering, and support for Protobuf-based data indexingâ€”making it suitable 
for use cases ranging from simple caching to complex real-time data processing in 
microservices and AI applications.
