# LangChain4j Logo License

The LangChain4j logo (a cup of coffee with a parrot next to it) was created by contributors to the LangChain4j project.

We dedicate this logo to the public domain under the [CC0 1.0 Universal Public Domain Dedication](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).

## Permitted uses

The logo is dedicated to the public domain (CC0). You may use, copy, modify, and redistribute it for any purpose, including commercial use.

This explicitly includes use in:

No attribution is required.

## Project identity

Although the logo is public domain, it is strongly associated with the LangChain4j open-source project. To avoid confusion:
- Do not use the logo in a way that implies your product or organization is officially part of, or endorsed by, LangChain4j unless it actually is.
- You are always welcome to use the logo in contexts that describe, teach, or discuss LangChain4j.

If you are unsure whether your use could be interpreted as endorsement, a simple request to the maintainers (via GitHub issues or community channels) is sufficient to get explicit permission in writing.
